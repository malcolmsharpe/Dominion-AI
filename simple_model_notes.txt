A sigmoid function is extremely good for predicting winrate given
province-count difference (when supply is fixed).
A linear fit, on the other hand, is quite bad.

The dependence on provinces-in-supply is roughly like you'd expect:
the fewer provinces remaining, the more ahead the player who has more.
Also, at equal count, it gives an advantage to the current
player. By eye, it looks roughly like an inverse relationship.

Since the logistic model is fantastic for fixed supply, it makes sense
to see how its parameters vary as the supply varies. They seem roughly
inverse to the remaining supply, which is nice. (Maybe remaining supply + 1?)
