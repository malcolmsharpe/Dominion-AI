With 15,000 games of self-play with a neural network, got results:
  SimpleAI: 38.2% +/- 4.0%
  Tie: 5.4% +/- 1.8%
  BigMoneyUltimate: 56.4% +/- 4.0%
This roughly matches the best performance achieved with the previous
technique of training on BMU self-play using batch learning. These
weights were however achieved by self-play and incremental learning,
which hopefully means there is more room for improvement.

I am tracking a new statistic that hopefully can help with tweaking
the learning rate: number of mistakes, which are
almost-certainly-incorrect moves such as buying a copper over a silver.


With some tweaking to the learning rate based on mistake rate, 20,000
games yielded:
  SimpleAI: 41.2% +/- 0.9%
  Tie: 6.3% +/- 0.4%
  BigMoneyUltimate: 52.5% +/- 0.9%
Not too bad.
