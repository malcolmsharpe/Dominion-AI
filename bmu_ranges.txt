In a typical game, BMU has:
  7 copper exactly.
  Up to ~9 silver.
  Up to ~7 gold.
  3-7 estates.
  0-5 duchies.
  0-5 provinces.

So, deck state count for a single player is bounded by about
  1 x 10 x 8 x 5 x 6 x 6 = 14,400
or for both players together,
  14,400^2 = 207,360,000
But this bound should be quite an overestimate.
